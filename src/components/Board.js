//we need a list of boards by title to appear in a box under a board header
//ITS JUST THEIR TITLES NOT COMPONENTS

//when clicking a title in board 
// title will also appear in selected board, which isnt a component? its just a display
//we never display more than one board at a time 

// its corresponding cards will appear (card list in cards)
// the board title will appear in the "cards for" header
//the new card form will appear
